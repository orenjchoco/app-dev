## Books over movies, over series forever but...

### when it comes to movies, i'd say mortal engines! ðŸ˜„
**Hear me out,** 
if you've read the book, I could understand your disappointment. It sounds contradictory to my declaration but it's only true because I came to know the book after watching the movie. Great read! *And watch* ðŸ‘€

I was baited with this movie poster:

Ikyk and understand why.

## As for the series...

Either **Star Wars** or **Harry Potter** 
- they're mainstream so explanation is not necessary ðŸ˜Œ

*Search them yourself, please*

## *The End!*
